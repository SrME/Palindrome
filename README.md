# Palindrome

The goal of this project is to write a simple program to check if a word is a palindrome.  To complete this project, you must complete the following:

1)  Have a command line for the user to enter a word.

2)  Verify that only a single word has been entered.

3)  Store the entry into a string, and then check to see if it is a palindrome.

4)  Display an answer on the screen of the results of the test.
